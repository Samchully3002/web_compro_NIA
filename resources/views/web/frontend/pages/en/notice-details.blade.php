                        Samchully Networks (CEO Lee Jin-hyuk) held the opening ceremony in 2023 in the conference room on January 2. 
                        <br><br>
                        In his New Year's speech, CEO Lim Jin-hyuk said, "Many difficulties and crises are expected to come before us in the new year, but I hope it will be a year that is as wise as a smart rabbit. In this era of rapidly changing business paradigms, we must become “Samchully (three thousand years)” people whose goal is to improve work skills and self-development throughout life. We must also establish a survival strategy with innovative ideas and a strong will for future development, as well as prepare and implement concrete practical steps to contribute to society and the international community through ESG management."
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, before the opening ceremony, there was an employee appreciation event. Deputy Managers Lim Dong-hyuk from the Global Business Team and Park So-yoon from the Platform Development Team each received the best employee award given by Han Ji-hoon as head of the Service Operations Team.
